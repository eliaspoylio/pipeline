# pstasks.py

Run series of shell commands with python.

Work in progress.

Motivation for pstasks.py was to have something like this to run from PowerShell on Windows with Standard Library, so at the moment there's a strong assumption towards running pstasks.py from that kind of environment.

## Dependencies

- Python 3

Tested with: 

Python 3.9.1 on Windows

Python 3.6.9 on Linux
